      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p>My name is Hadley Shapland and I am a STEP Intern at Google. 
          I am a Computer Science and Math major at Vanderbilt University and will 
          be starting my junior year this fall. This is my first time working at Google
           and I am excited to learn and improve my skills this summer. One of the 
           benefits of working from home is that I get to ride my horse, Kip! This is a 
           picture of me and Kip:</p>
