      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <p>My name is Hadley Shapland and I am a 
      <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/">STEP Intern</a> 
      at Google. I am a Computer Science and Math major at Vanderbilt University and will 
      be starting my junior year this fall. I am from Champaign, IL and live on my family 
      farm. In my free time, I love to read, ride my horse Kip, go hiking, watch movies, 
      and spend time with friends. Below is a picture of Kip.</p>
