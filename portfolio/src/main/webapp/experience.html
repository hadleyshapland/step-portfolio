      <h3>Why CS?</h3>
      <p>I was first introduced to CS in fifth grade through the FIRST LEGO League 
          robotic competitions. In high school, I wanted to continue learning about CS, 
          so I co-founded a Girls Who Code club. We met weekly and used tutorials to 
          teach ourselves basic coding, wrote simple apps in Swift, watched TED talks, 
          and invited local women in STEM to speak. I took my first actual coding class 
          in Java freshman year of college while my major was Biomedical Engineering and 
          honestly, I fell in love. I enjoy learning, but for the first time ever, it 
          didn’t feel like school; I enjoyed coding so much that I worked extra to 
          develop my own technical skills, spending vast amounts of personal time 
          reading ahead in the textbook, watching tutorials, and creating my own programs 
          for random small tasks that I thought of. I changed my major to CS before the end 
          of freshman year and I joined Women in Computing to gain exposure to the field. Last summer, 
          during my internship at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, I was 
          chosen as the intern who developed scripts to analyze MRI data for my team’s project.</p>
